# ElonaMK

A game made with Lua and LOVE2D

## Running the game

Download or clone this repo, and then run the project folder(/ElonaMK) with LÖVE, which can be downloaded [here](https://love2d.org/). 
The game will only work properly with versions 11.0 or later. 
The easiest way to run a project with LÖVE is to drag the project folder(/ElonaMK) onto a LÖVE application shortcut.
